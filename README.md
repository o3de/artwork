# O3DE Logos

In this repo, we have artwork in standard formats for O3DE. We prepare artwork in 2 formats (PNG & SVG) and at least 3 versions (color/black/white).

With many browsers, you can right-click and copy the logo of your choice below. Please note that although PNG is more common, SVG file sizes are smaller, supported in all modern web browsers, and a high-resolution format suitable for both print and high-resolution computer screens.

Use of any trademark or logo is subject to the trademark policy available at https://www.linuxfoundation.org/trademark-usage with the key excepts available at LICENSE.md. Refer to the [O3DE Brand Guide](https://o3de.org/brand-guidelines/) for guidelines on how to use the logo.
